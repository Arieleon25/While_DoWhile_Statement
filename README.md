# While_DoWhile_Statement
The While_DoWhile_Statement project is a console application that involves guessing a country using boolean comparisons with both while and do while statements. The program prompts the user to make guesses until the correct country is guessed using the appropriate looping structures.

# Project Description
The While_DoWhile_Statement project focuses on utilizing while and do while loops to compare user input with a target country. The program will continue to prompt the user for guesses until the correct country is guessed using the appropriate looping structure.

# Instructions
Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to guess the name of a country.

The program will use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for guesses until the correct country is guessed. The loop structure is as follows:

Initialize a boolean variable to false to track whether the correct guess has been made.

Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter a guess for the country name.

Compare the user's guess to the correct country name using a boolean comparison.

If the guess is correct, set the boolean variable to true to indicate a correct guess.

If the guess is incorrect, provide appropriate feedback to the user.

Repeat the loop until the correct country is guessed.

Once the correct country is guessed using the while loop, the program will move on to the next stage.

The program will now use a do while loop to compare user input with the correct country name. The loop structure is as follows:

Initialize a boolean variable to true to enter the loop at least once.

Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter a guess for the country name.

Compare the user's guess to the correct country name using a boolean comparison.

If the guess is correct, set the boolean variable to false to exit the loop.

If the guess is incorrect, provide appropriate feedback to the user.

Repeat the loop until the correct country is guessed.

Once the correct country is guessed using the do while loop, the program will conclude.
